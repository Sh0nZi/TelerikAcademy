			Sometimes I convince myself I'm invincible. I can drive that much faster, and drink that much more. 
			I am a teenager, fuck you. I am immortal.

			Then you see the obituaries and the facebook posts and a feeling sinks in. Suddenly, 
			the smoke screen becomes just a little more transparent. You can see something- though 
			you cant say for sure what it is. Next there is the silhouette. A crumpled lump on the ground 
			that becomes more human and broken with every RIP facebook post. 
		</p>

			Thats when you know. You know, but you wont let yourself accept that that girl from elementry 
			school is dead.  Real life, actually never coming back, dead. Finally, the shadows become spotlights, 
			as if the whole world is illuminating Amy’s cold and bloody body. The dead twin. 
			They are all screaming at you that life ends. They write it in letters so bold that 
			even when you close your eyes the words are burnt into your eyelids, “you too, are going to die”.
		</p>
		<p>But you still cant wrap your aching mind around forever.</p>
